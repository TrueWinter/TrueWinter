### Hi ðŸ‘‹

I'm TrueWinter (he/they), a software and website developer from South Africa. I also find and responsibly disclose security vulnerabilities.

I develop a lot of software that does various tasks. Many of my repositories contain websites or web APIs, but I do also write Minecraft server plugins and occasionally apps. Not all of the work I do is on my profile though (and much of my work is private), but I also publish code in the organizations I'm in.
